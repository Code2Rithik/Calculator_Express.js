# BMI and Addition Calculator

Here is a calculator BMI Calculator that I created using express.js.

First, download the zip and <code>cd</code> into the directory

Then, run <code> npm install </code>

After that, type <code>node calculator.js</code>

Then, open <code>localhost:3000/bmicalculator</code> in a browser and you will be able to view the project

Secret: If you remove <code>/bmicalculator</code> and type only <code>localhost:3000</code>, you will be getting an addition calculator
